# Digital-Doily
Program to create digital doilies. Assignment in Programming II module.

A [doily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doily)(also doiley, doilie, doyly, doyley) is an ornamental mat, typically made of paper or fabric, and variously used for protecting surfaces or binding flowers, in food service presentation, or as a head covering or clothing ornamentation. It is characterized by openwork, which allows the surface of the underlying object to show through. [Wikipeadia]

Our task was to use the Java Swing library to create a program that allows a user to create a doily by choosing pen colour, thickness and number of lines reflecting the drawing. It also saves finsihed masterprieces as PNG files. Have a go! Run "Main.java".
